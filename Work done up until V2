So the first version I uploaded was a template for the project to come.
A lot of setting up and preparation was done in this version.

In the second version, Code was added to make the buildings have basic functionality. This functionality was not perfect but it worked. It will be edited
to be more optimized later on.

No comments have been made to code yet.
